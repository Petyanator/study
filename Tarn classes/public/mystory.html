        <h1 class="story">At 20, Alex's days were full of new experiences. 
            One sunny morning, he woke up early for his first solo hike. 
            As he walked up the forest path, the fresh air filled his lungs, and birds sang around him. 
            At the top, he sat on a rock, looking at the city below. 
            He felt free and knew that each day was a new adventure just starting.
